# Algoritma_ve_programlama_proje

This project was created by Erdal NAYÄ°R and Yakup ABACI for university algorithm project

Even though Algorithm's predictions are wrong,Purpose of this project is to measure our understandings of string operations and how well we implemented those operations to our project.

I and my teammate got 98 points out of 100 from this project(not 100 because of we made a small mistake about euclid distance)
